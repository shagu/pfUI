PFUI for V+ Private Server (v.05)

This is a modification for the popular PFUI addon for Vanilla WoW made by shagu. For information on the excellent original mod visit shagu/pfUI

As the V+ Server adds lots of new skills and alters a lot of baseline skills along with their cast times, cooldowns, duration and adds talents
to change those, by default this mod unfortunately doesn't show the right info ingame.

With this modification extension I aim to make the ingame information display correctly. Please note that I'm an amateur programer and mostly 
modified code by simply reading into it and with lots of help and advice from Thirinena (hawaiisa) from the V+ server (thx a lot) and shagu (thx too).
Not all the listed changes have been tested yet.


Installation:

Use the Green Code Button to the top right and download the zip file. Extrace the file into your wow/interface/addons folder and rename it to Pfui (remove the -master). If you already have PFui installed overwrite the existing folder, saved configuations wont be affected by this.
Note: at the moment the mod extension only works with the English Game Client.

- adding the custom V+ spells into the library that show the correct times then

- for some reason Frostbolts first cast always shows the wrong duration (e.g. 6s debuff although it should be 7 seconds, subsequent casts show correctly), sometimes the debuff doesnt register at all
