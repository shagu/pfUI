# pfUI

An AddOn for World of Warcraft (1.12.1), mostly known as "Vanilla", which aims to be a full replacement for the original interface. The design is highly inspired by TukUI and ElvUI, bringing modern features and a minimalistic style that's easy to use right from the start. It is entirely written from scratch without any inclusion of third-party addons or libraries.

This is **not** an addon-pack like [ShaguUI](http://shagu.org/shaguui/), however, there will be support for external addons like MobHealth3 and HealComm, but they will never be shipped within the package.

## FAQ
**What does "pfUI" stand for?**  
The term "*pfui!*" is german and simply stands for "*pooh!*", because I'm not a
big fan of creating configuration UI's, especially not via the Wow-API
(you might have noticed that in ShaguUI).

**How can I donate?**  
You can't. I'm doing this for fun. Enjoy!

**How do I report a Bug?**  
Please provide as much information as possible in the [Bugtracker](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues).
If there is an error message, provide the full content of it. Just telling that "there is an error" won't help any of us.
Please consider adding additional information such as: since when did you got the error,
does it still happen using a clean configuration, what other addons are loaded and which version you're running.
When playing with a non-english client, the language might be relevant too. If possible, explain how people can reproduce the issue.

**How can I contribute?**  
Report Errors, Issues and Feature Requests in the [Bugtracker](https://github.com/shagu/pfUI/issues).
Please make sure to have the latest version installed and check for conflicting addons beforehand.

**Can I use Clique with pfUI?**  
A pfUI compatible version of Clique can be found [Here](https://github.com/shagu/Clique/releases). If you want to keep your current version of Clique, you'll have to apply this [Patch](https://github.com/shagu/Clique/commit/a5ee56c3f803afbdda07bae9cd330e0d4a75d75a).

**Why do I see player names instead of linked items?**  
That's a conflict with prat. You'll have to either disable Prat's class colors by typing `/prat playernames toggle` or disable pfUI's class colors within the settings dialog. The entry can found in the chat section: `Enable Class Colors`.

**How do I show the Damage- and Threatmeter Dock?**  
If you enabled the "dock"-feature for your external (third-party) meters such as DPSMate or KTM, then you'll be able to toggle between them and the Right Chat by clicking on the ">" symbol on the bottom-right panel.

**How can I enable mouseover cast?**  
Create a macro with "/pfcast SPELLNAME". If you also want to see the cooldown, You might want to add "/run if nil then CastSpellByName("SPELLNAME") end" on top of the macro.

**Everything from scratch?! Are you insane?**  
Most probably, yes.
